## Security Practices

- The application runs in an isolated container environment (Docker), limiting access to your system.
- No information is sent to third-party servers except those explicitly selected by the user (Google or Microsoft).
- No credentials, tokens, or personal data are stored outside the userâ€™s local environment.
- OAuth scopes requested are limited to what is strictly necessary for the app to function.
- Users have full control over the location and storage of their data.
