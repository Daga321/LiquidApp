## About the Project

**LiquidApp** is a lightweight tool designed to calculate and distribute utility bills in multi-unit homes or mixed-use buildings.  
It was originally built to help with a real family situation, aiming to simplify a tedious task and reduce misunderstandings.  
While simple, the tool automates repetitive calculations and offers a clear summary of individual payments.

## Key Features

- **Automatic calculation** of how much each unit should pay.
- **Three billing methods**:
  - Based on individual consumption (e.g., internal water meters)
  - Based on percentage (assigned to each unit)
  - Based on the number of people per unit
- **Adjustments per unit** for discounts, penalties, or extra services.
- **Summary image export** ready to be shared digitally.
